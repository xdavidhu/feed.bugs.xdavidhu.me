Summary: Webpage can execute Google Assistant commands without any permissions

Steps to reproduce:
  1. Generate the TTS audio files using the Google Cloud TTS API, using the text commands in the JavaScript comments
  2. Make sure the device is not muted, or have headphones connected
  3. Open the POC HTML on an Android device with Google Assistant
  4. Click one of the POC attacks
  5. See the Google Assistant commands execute automatically, without any permissions

This attack works by first triggering Google Assistant using a deeplink (acquired from the mobile "google.com" page, where there is a button to trigger the Assistant) and after a bit of delay, playing TTS generated commands as plain audio.

This attack can be exploited the same way (or sending a "VOICE_COMMAND" intent) by Android applications (without any permissions required), actually that was my first idea, but I figured that the impact is way higher if a victim only has to visit a webpage to get the same results.

One weird thing I noticed while testing using the Chrome browser on Android, is that an audio file is played differently depending on the length. This forced me to split the attacking commands into different audio files (for example the "share location" and the phone number are different commands), since when I tried to play the longer audio file, Chrome interpreted it as a "media", and displayed the media control notification as well. And triggering Assistant while a longer audio "media" was playing, caused Assistant to pause the audio. When using shorter audio files, the media control notification did not appear, and Assistant didn't pause the media, allowing it to execute the malicious commands.

I used the Cloud Text-to-Speech API to generate the audio files. I used language_code='en-US' and name="en-US-Wavenet-A" to generate the audio files. All of the text input used to generate the audio files can be found in the JavaScript comments.

I attached 2 POC videos to make it easier to see the attack running:

Attack scenario:
This attack allows an attacker to execute malicious commands in Google Assistant, on behalf of the victim, just by making the victim visit a webpage. The Assistant has access to extremely sensitive information, and may be able to control the victim's Google Account, Smart Home, and other IOT appliances. An attacker should never be able to execute commands in Google Assistant, without having sufficient permissions.

Limitation of this attack:
- The phone must not be muted or have headphones connected, since Google Assistant wouldn't hear the malicious audio
- The malicious commands could be heard by the user, since they are playing out loud
- The attack will fail if the user closes the Assistant mid-attack

Why I checked "Is this vulnerability public or known to third parties?":
I found out about this issue (only the idea of playing the commands as audio, using the phone) by browsing forums where people were talking about finding ways to execute Assistant commands to automate their different workflows. This method was posted publicly as an "Automate" (Android automating app) "flow" to execute an Assistant command. Their motivations wasn't malicious, but I realized that this method could be abused by an attacker, and made it into a POC. Therefore, I mark this vulnerability as public, since anyone can find this information and use it for malicious purposes.

One possible fix for this could be to disable *any* playing audio on the device when the Assistant is listening for commands.

One more thing to add is that if a Android application is using the same method to issue malicious Assistant commands, it could bypass one or more of the above mentioned limitations that a website is unable to:

- The muted phone, by playing the audio as an alarm so it plays even when the phone is set to silent
- The need for not having any headphones plugged in / connected, by playing the audio as an alarm, because in my limited research that seems to play on both the headphones and on the speaker, or by routing the audio using the setSpeakerphoneOn(true) method.

These should not require any/dangerous permissions.

Thanks,
David

Hi!

I have plans around potentially disclosing this issue in a talk at a security conference in October 2020.
I am writing this to ask about the status of this issue and to request permission to disclose this issue when it will become fully fixed.

Would the disclosure time of October 2020 be possible?

Thank you,
David

---

**Vendor - 2020-04-30 16:07**

Hi David,

Disclosure around October 2020 should be fine.

Best of luck with preparing with your talk and if you would like us to review any of your presentation for feedback, please let us know!

Regards,
[redacted], Google Trust & Safety

Best of luck in your future research,

**Me - 2021-02-25 09:04**

Hi,

Can I ask what the fix was here? My POC broke, looks like that link which triggered Assistant is now disabled. But, I can still play malicious audio to Assistant, if it was triggered manually.

Is only the "programatic triggering" that was removed? If so, if I find any other way to auto-trigger Assistant, is that considered a new bug?

Thank you,
David

---

**Me - 2021-03-03 10:17**

Hi David,

I'm not sure if I fully understand your question - so please let me know if I missed anything.

In your initial report, you were able to execute Google Assistant commands automatically, without any user permissions.
The root cause that led to this particular issue has been fixed now. Of course, if you are able to identify a different way to auto-trigger Assistant we would be really curious to hear about.

Let me know if you have any other questions!

Best,
[redacted]

**Vendor - 2021-04-28 10:42**

The status of this report is being changed so that our automation will notify you when the underlying bug is fixed. There isn't any action needed on your part here, just a book-keeping change. Apologies for the extra noise/email.

Hi,

Good news (for me, at least), the deeplink is back!
It looks to have some extra protection, and sometimes it's glitching all over the place, but I was able to bypass it if the user has some music playing:

https://youtu.be/phIgnbaGDHo

Thank you,
David

---

**Me - 2021-03-14 18:35**

Some extra info, if teams would be confused about the origin of this deeplink:

This link is used on google.com, when visited with an (android?) User Agent. \

When the bug got fixed initially, this button also became unusable (but it was still there), but few days ago I pressed it, and it was working again, hence I tried the POC. And now it works again, with the same exact deeplink the original POC had in 2019.

I attached a picture of what it looks like.

**Vendor - 2021-03-18 13:17**

Hi David,

Great job (as always) - thank you for pointing that out!

**Me - 2021-08-11 13:07**

Hi,

It looks like to me that if the Assistant is opened with deeplink, it requires a manual press on the mic icon to start listening. This seems to fix the issue.

Can you please confirm this? Did the product team implement this as a fix?

**[Disclosure Warning!]** \
I plan to disclose this bug at a security conference in October, and in an internal company-wide talk **on Friday**.

Please let me know if I should delay disclosure.

Thank you, \
David

**Me - 2021-08-13 07:36**

[redacted] confirmed that the product team has indeed pushed a fix. I'll disclose the issue today.
