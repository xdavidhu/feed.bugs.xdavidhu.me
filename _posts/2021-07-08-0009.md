title: "IDOR on clientauthconfig.googleapis.com"
---

**Summary:**

Using the `/v1/brands/lookupkey/brand/[brand_id]` endpoint on the `clientauthconfig.googleapis.com` API, its possible to request information about any brand, without any authentication.

Since the `brand_id` is normally the same as the `project_number`, only the `project_number` is needed to exploit this vulnerability. The `project_number` can leak from an API key when sending a request with the key to an API that's not enabled on the key's project.

The endpoint even returns `brand`s that are Google Workspace internal. (`"isOrgInternal": true`)

Normally, even if you have the `client_id`, trying to start an OAuth flow on a Workspace internal `brand` as an outsider only returns a `Error 403: org_internal This client is restricted to users within its organization.` error, and doesn't leak any information about the `brand`'s name, or other details. So those details are clearly considered private, but this endpoint leaks them.

**Core Issue:**

There is no access control on the `/v1/brands/lookupkey/brand/[brand_id]` endpoint. \
It should require `read` permissions on the `brand`'s project. This is even stated in the API's Discovery Document:

```
Retrieve branding info given a brand_id.
Requires read permission on the associated project.
```

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. Create a GCP project, and note the project's `project_number`
2. Go to `https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent` and set up a consent screen (`brand`)
3. Send this unauthenticated `GET` request (the API key is from Cloud Console):

```
GET /v1/brands/lookupkey/brand/[project_number]?readMask=*&%24outputDefaults=true HTTP/1.1
Host: clientauthconfig.googleapis.com
Origin: https://console.cloud.google.com
X-Goog-Api-Key: AIzaSyCI-zsRP85UVOi0DjtiCwWBwQ1djDy741g


```

{:start="4"}
4. See the `brand` object returned in the response

**Attack scenario:**

Any unauthenticated attacker who knows the target project's `project_number`. As I stated above, the project_number can leak from a publicly exposed API key when sending a request with the key to an API that's not enabled on the key's project.

Hi,

Just a heads up, this report will be disclosed in 20 days, on `2021-07-08`.

Is this really intended behaviour? I think the documentation states somewhere that org internal clients are not visible to anyone outside the org. Trying to log in to an org internal client with OAuth also throws an error without providing any information (like name, email address), but this bug leaks those details.

Thank you, \
David

Hi, 

The product team thinks that this information is public.  The info is also available through other sources.  If someone can construct the authorization URL using the client-id and redirect URI, they would be able to get part of this data on the consent screen (eg. app name, privacy policy, etc.).

Why do you think that the info should be private?  If you can find it, can you give a link to the documentation that mentions that internal clients aren't visible?
