title: "CloudKit Share Records leak the title of private iCloud files"
---

**Summary:**

CloudKit Share Records of all iCloud documents/files leak the document's/file's title via the `records/resolve` API call, even when `Who can access` is set to `Only people you invite`. This issue affects iCloud documents/files of all type, including Pages, Number, Keynote, and files in iCloud Drive.

**Core Issue:**

When a document/file is shared with a specific email address and `Who can access` is set to `Only people you invite`, a CloudKit Share Record get's created. The link generated by the frontend looks like this: `https://www.icloud.com/[product]/[ShortGUID]#[document-title]`. Storing the title in the hash implies that the title should be inaccessible to a yet-logged-in user, hence transported in the URL's hash segment. But even as an unauthenticated user, querying the `records/resolve` CloudKit endpoint with the file's ShortGUID, the title is returned in the `share` -> `fields` -> `cloudkit.title` field.

Other privacy sensitive data is returned in the same unauthenticated response, such as the owner of the document. This behaviour could as well be debated. Other similar providers like Google Drive don't expose the owner of a file if the requestor has no access to the document.

**Impact:**

If an iCloud file is shared with at least one entity & the attacker knows the file's ShortGUID, the attacker can query the file's title without having any access to the document.
Knowing a file's ShortGUID is not a privileged position, and it should only provide access to the tile if the file's `Who can access` is set to `Anyone with the link`.

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. Log in to iCloud and visit `https://www.icloud.com/pages/`
2. Create a new document, and set a custom title. Make some changes to the file to trigger a save.
3. Share the file with a specific email address, and make sure `Share Options` -> `Who can access` is set to `Only people you invite`.
4. Extract the ShortGUID from the generated link.
5. Replace `ShortGUID_From_Step_4` in the body of this HTTP request, and send it.

```
POST /database/1/com.apple.cloudkit/production/public/records/resolve HTTP/1.1
Host: ckdatabasews.icloud.com
Content-Length: 56

{"shortGUIDs":[{"value":"[ShortGUID_From_Step_4]"}]}
```

{:start="6"}
6. See that the file's current title is returned in response to this unauthenticated request.

Hi,

I have recorded a proof of concept video of the issue:
[https://youtu.be/hViPqrHzyIs](https://youtu.be/hViPqrHzyIs)

As you can see, the final manually sent unauthenticated HTTP request with the ShortGUID exposes the title of the document, even though the document's `Who can access` setting is set to `Only people you invite`.

Thank you, \
David

Hello,

I just tested the issue and it looks fixed, seemingly even for previously generated share items.

I have a few final questions regarding this bug:

Thank you, \
